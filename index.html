        <p> Hi! I am Esther J. Choi, a rising 6th grader that is 11 years old. I made this website to share who I am, what I like, and what I do to others. I hope you enjoy learning more about me, and perhaps in relating to me in similar ways. You can always refer to the navigation bar on top of the page if you want to skip a section. Now, enjoy reading about me! (P.S. I encourage you to try making a website on your own, on any topic you want! The coding languages that I used were HTML and CSS, and the platform that I used was Visual Studio Code.) </p>
        </section>
        <section id="my_family">
        <h2> My Family </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <div>
        <p> My family isn't that large, since I am an only child, and therefore don't have any siblings. My father is a buisness man who works every weekday to help elderly people enjoy their day at his facility, called Agape. My mother is a pharmacist who works in the same building that my father owns. She provides the medication that the elders need for their wellbeing. I am also the owner of 2 cats, with the names of Atom and Crystal. They are both black and white, two littermates amongst a litter of 4 kittens. My parents have provided me the tools to success, and I can't thank them enough for it. They put me on the road to become better every day, and they have helped me more times than I can count. They have taught me many necessary attributes in life, which will help me throughout my years. That is why my family is so important to me. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="hobbies">
        <h2> Hobbies </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I have mutiple hobbies, including reading and playing with my cats. I love to read, mostly fiction and fantasy, though sometimes I will pick up a nonfiction book. Some of my favorite series include Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Heroes of Olympus, Wings of Fire, Warriors, the Seven Realms, and the Kingdom Keepers. I could read all day if I wanted to. I usually read with my kindle, since it damages my eyes less, but I also read using a real book as well. Reading helps me to learn new words in a fun way, and imagine stories of my own. I believe that reading is essential in becoming a better writer and reader, which is why I think that reading is a great hobby to have! I hope that you love to read books as well. I encourage all of the people out there to read at home, especially during the pandemic, when people are suffering from depression. Reading will fill the gap of talking to friends in person. Also, playing with my cats helps me to relax and enjoy the day. My cats are like a stress reliever, and whenever I feel bad, my cats always help me feel better. It helps both them and myself to have some fun during the day. Those are the reasons why I love having these hobbies! </p>

        <h2> Achievements </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> My achievements include playing two instruments, speaking 4 languages, qualifying for Algebra 1 Honors, placing in the Nationals level for Math Kangaroo, and so much more! <ol> <li> The two instruments that I play are the violin and piano. I am pretty advanced at them, and passed the audition for AYDO Second and First Violin. AYDO (American Youth Debut Orchestra) is an orchestra that is part of the AYPO program. AYDO is the lowest level, while AYP is the highest. I have auditioned for AYSE, the next level of orchestras, but failed. To read more about the AYDO orchestra, <a href="https://www.aypo.org/aydo"> click here. </a> I am currently playing Mozart Violin Concerto No. 5 Mvmt. 1, the last of his violin concertos. To listen to the music, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7lkZcROpjU"> click here. </a> For piano, I haven't really done any competitions, but I am playing Mozart Piano Sonata No. 11 and Chopin Waltz Posthumous No. 14 in E minor. To listen to the sonata, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ1mj9IaczQ"> click on this link. </a> 
        To listen to the Chopin waltz, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YNOfilFSog"> click here. </a> </li> <li> The four languages that I can speak are English, Korean, Spanish, and Chinese. I am not fluent in Chinese, but I can speak a few words and read passages. I am currently learning Chinese and Spanish. English is my main language, while Korean is my second language from my parents. I go to Chinese School every day at Hope Chinese School. I am currently learning 6th grade Chinese. To go to their website, <a href="https://www.hopechineseschool.org/campus/8/"> click here. </a> I am learning Spanish using Duolingo and LanguageConvo, a program that lets you schedule classes with a native teacher in whatever language you want to learn. Duolingo is an app that teaches you a new language through a course of lessons and different topics. To go to the Duolingo website, <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/"> click on this link. </a> To get to the LanguageConvo website, <a href="https://www.languageconvo.com/"> click here. </a> </li> <li> Algebra 1 Honors lets you take Algebra 1 classes in 6th grade. I have yet to take the determining tests, but the fact that I have qualified for the tests is apparently amazing, since very few students get chosen. One of the two tests is the IAAT or the Iowa Algebra Aptitude Test, which in order to take, you must pass the first test. To learn more about the IAAT's influence on the passing of Algebra 1 Honors, <a href="https://www.fcps.edu/node/41105"> click here. </a> </li> <li> Math Kangaroo is a math competition that takes place every year. It scores you depending on your score on the exam given every year. The exams are divided into grade levels, and the top twenty get the national level, while the top 5 or so get the state level. I have gotten the national level almost every time that I have taken the Math Kangaroo exam. To read more about the Math Kangaroo, <a href="https://www.mathkangaroo.org/"> click here. </a> </li> <li> I am also pretty good at coding, as you can see from this website. I have been taking classes with WhiteHatJr, now called Byju's Future School. They provide a program with 144 classes that covers a whole ton of coding, starting from blockly coding, and moving up to HTML, CSS, and JS coding. I am at around class 125 right now, and I am loving the system. This is the <a href="https://www.whitehatjr.com/"> WhiteHatJr website </a>, and this is the <a href="https://www.byjusfutureschool.com/"> Byju's Future School website. </a> I really recommend taking coding lessons, if you are interested, because the classes cover a lot of topics, from Sequences, Loops, and App Designing, to Web Development, Image Recognition, and Neural Networks. All of the lessons are 1 to 1, which makes learning super fun! </li> </ol> <h3 id="conclusion"> I hope that you are as proud of your achievements as I am! </h3> </p>

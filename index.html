        <div class="line">
        </div>
        <p> Hi! I am Esther J. Choi, a rising 6th grader that is 11 years old. I made this website to share who I am, what I like, and what I do to others. I hope you enjoy learning more about me, and perhaps in relating to me in similar ways. You can always refer to the navigation bar on top of the page if you want to skip a section. Now, enjoy reading about me! (P.S. I encourage you to try making a website on your own, on any topic you want! The coding languages that I used were HTML and CSS, and the platform that I used was Visual Studio Code.) </p>
        </section>
        <section id="my_family">
        <h2> My Family </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <div>
        <p> My family isn't that large, since I am an only child, and therefore don't have any siblings. My father is a buisness man who works every weekday to help elderly people enjoy their day at his facility, called Agape. My mother is a pharmacist who works in the same building that my father owns. She provides the medication that the elders need for their wellbeing. I am also the owner of 2 cats, with the names of Atom and Crystal. They are both black and white, two littermates amongst a litter of 4 kittens. My parents have provided me the tools to success, and I can't thank them enough for it. They put me on the road to become better every day, and they have helped me more times than I can count. They have taught me many necessary attributes in life, which will help me throughout my years. That is why my family is so important to me. </p>

        <section id="hobbies">
        <h2> Hobbies </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I have mutiple hobbies, including reading and playing with my cats. I love to read, mostly fiction and fantasy, though sometimes I will pick up a nonfiction book. Some of my favorite series include Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Heroes of Olympus, Wings of Fire, Warriors, the Seven Realms, and the Kingdom Keepers. I could read all day if I wanted to. I usually read with my kindle, since it damages my eyes less, but I also read using a real book as well. Reading helps me to learn new words in a fun way, and imagine stories of my own. I believe that reading is essential in becoming a better writer and reader, which is why I think that reading is a great hobby to have! I hope that you love to read books as well. I encourage all of the people out there to read at home, especially during the pandemic, when people are suffering from depression. Reading will fill the gap of talking to friends in person. Also, playing with my cats helps me to relax and enjoy the day. My cats are like a stress reliever, and whenever I feel bad, my cats always help me feel better. It helps both them and myself to have some fun during the day. Those are the reasons why I love having these hobbies! </p>

        <p> My achievements include playing two instruments, speaking 4 languages, qualifying for Algebra 1 Honors, placing in the Nationals level for Math Kangaroo, and so much more! The two instruments that I play are the violin and piano. I am pretty advanced at them, and passed the audition for AYDO Second Violin. </p>

        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <div class="line">
        </div>
        <p> Hi! I am Esther J. Choi, an 8th grader that is 13 (soon to be 14) years old. I made this website to share who I am, what I like, and what I do to others. I hope you enjoy learning more about me, and perhaps in relating to me in similar ways. You can always refer to the navigation bar on top of the page if you want to skip a section. Now, enjoy reading about me! (P.S. I encourage you to try making a website on your own, on any topic you want! The coding languages that I used were HTML and CSS, and the platform that I used was Visual Studio Code.) </p>
        </section>
        <section id="my_family">
        <h2> My Family </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <div>
        <p> My family isn't that large, since I am an only child, and therefore don't have any siblings. My father is a business man who works every weekday to help elderly people enjoy their day at his facility, called Agape. My mother is a pharmacist who works in the same building that my father owns. She provides the medication that the elders need for their wellbeing. I am also the owner of 2 cats, with the names of Atom and Crystal. They are both black and white, two littermates amongst a litter of 4 kittens. I have a dog, Bori, named after the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis). She is a border collie/laborador retriever mix, and loves to run around. She is also black and white, just like my cats. My parents have provided me the tools to success, and I can't thank them enough for it. They put me on the road to become better every day, and they have helped me more times than I can count. They have taught me many necessary attributes in life, which will help me throughout my years. That is why my family is so important to me. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="hobbies">
        <h2> Hobbies </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I have mutiple hobbies, including reading, playing with my cats/dog, and swimming. I love to read, mostly fiction and fantasy, though sometimes I will pick up a nonfiction book. Most of the nonfiction books that I read are about the human body/biology, as I am really interested in biology, anatomy, and physiology, and hope to apply these interests as a doctor (my dream job!) in my later years. Some of my favorite series include Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Heroes of Olympus, Wings of Fire, Warriors, the Seven Realms, and the Kingdom Keepers. I could read all day if I wanted to. I usually read with my kindle, since it damages my eyes less, but I also read using a real book as well. Reading helps me to learn new words in a fun way, and imagine stories of my own. I believe that reading is essential in becoming a better writer and reader, which is why I think that reading is a great hobby to have! I hope that you love to read books as well. I encourage all of the people out there to read at home, especially after the pandemic, when people are still suffering from depression/anxiety. Reading will fill the gap of talking to friends in person. Also, playing with my cats/dog helps me to relax and enjoy the day. My cats/dog are like a stress reliever, and whenever I feel bad, my cats/dog always help me feel better. It helps both them and myself to have some fun during the day. All of my pets are the sweetest things, and I love them so much, which helps me to stay calm and focused. I used to swim competitively, as my sport, but it didn't fit in with my schedule. I was already doing a lot of activities/extracurriculars, and I decided to prioritize my academic interests over swimming. I still swim when I can, during the summer, when my pool opens. (I have a pool at my house.) It is a fun hobby that my parents and my dog share with me, and it makes all of our summer vacations much more enjoyable and memorable. Since I don't play a sport (competitively/outside of school), I exercise at home. Every morning, at 5:00 AM to 5:40 AM, I go to the "gym" downstairs and work out (lift weights, run 2 miles). This has helped me to have more energy throughout the day and to feel better about my own body. Those are the reasons why I love having these hobbies! </p>

        <section id="activities">
        <h2> Activities </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I do a lot of things during the week. I obviously have homework from school, but that doesn't take me too long. My extracurricular activities include violin lessons, coding classes, Spanish lessons, and volunteering at my church from 9:30 - 11:30 every Sunday. I do violin on Sundays, coding classes on Mondays, and Spanish lessons on Tuesdays. I have private tutors for all of these activities, though I used Byju's Future School for coding classes and LanguageConvo for my Spanish Lessons during the pandemic. I also do my own activities, including my math textbook and practicing my instrument. I am doing the AoPS Calculus textbook by David Patrick, in order to solidify my understanding of the subject and prepare for my high school years. I started doing math on my own while I was taking Algebra 1 Honors, in order to satisfy my thirst for knowledge. I was curious about the topics in the next class, so I decided to just try them on my own. This textbook includes problems from math competitions, such as the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, the Integration Bee from MIT, and the Harvard/MIT Mathmetics Tournament. To visit the AoPS website, click on <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/"> this link. </a> I practice (or try to) playing my violin for 1 hour every weekday, and 2 hours every weekend. I usually enjoy practicing once I start, which is why and how I have come this far. I have to thank all of the people who have helped me, my teachers, my parents, and my friends, for encouraging me to persevere and continue through my hardships. They are the reason I have come this far in my life. </p>

        <section id="achievements">
        <h2> Achievements </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> My achievements include playing two instruments, speaking 4 languages, qualifying for Algebra 1 Honors, placing in the Nationals level for Math Kangaroo, and so much more! <ol> <li> The two instruments that I play are the violin and piano. I stopped taking piano lessons, as playing two instruments and taking private lessons for them both proved to be too much for me. I am pretty advanced at the violin, and passed the audition for AYDO Second and First Violin. AYDO (American Youth Debut Orchestra) is an orchestra that is part of the AYPO program. AYDO is the lowest level, while AYP is the highest. I have auditioned for AYSE, the next level of orchestras, but decided not to pursue it due to my busy schedule. To read more about the AYDO orchestra, <a href="https://www.aypo.org/aydo"> click here. </a> Right now, I play Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E Minor, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDwKJ6bBXEA&pp=ygUbbWVuZGVsc3NvaG4gdmlvbGluIGNvbmNlcnRv">right here.</a> I have played Bach Violin Sonata No. 3, Largo and Allegro Assai. To listen to the piece(s), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lej1nHZBMgc"> click here. </a> I have also played Viotti Concerto No. 22, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1f7mK6USW8"> right here. </a> I am also the concertmaster of my school orchestra, qualified/got into District Honors Orchestra, and got a 1 in Solo & Ensemble Festival in both 1st and 7th grade. For piano, I haven't really done any competitions, but I was playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKGR-b13_co">Beethoven Piano Sonata 1 (1st and 2nd mvmt),</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apz6yKXrKC8"> Bach Prelude and Fugue No. 3 in C# Major,</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5ehvY8YyA"> Debussy's Suite Bergamasque (Prelude),</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy5UHK4EeM8">Chopin Impromptu No. 4.</a>
         </li> <li> The (four) languages that I can speak are English, Korean, Spanish, and (Chinese). I stopped taking Chinese lessons due to my time constraints, though I remember a little bit of Mandarin. I am currently learning Spanish in school, and I have a tutor to get me ahead. I want to take AP Spanish in high school, and my tutor is helping me get prepared for such a notoriously difficult class. English is my first language, while Korean is my second language from my parents. I used to go to Chinese School every Sunday at Hope Chinese School. I was in one of the 6th grade Chinese classes. To go to their website, <a href="https://www.hopechineseschool.org/campus/8/"> click here. </a> I was learning Spanish using Duolingo and LanguageConvo, a program that lets you schedule classes with a native teacher in whatever language you want to learn. Duolingo is an app that teaches you a new language through a course of lessons and different topics. To go to the Duolingo website, <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/"> click on this link. </a> To get to the LanguageConvo website, <a href="https://www.languageconvo.com/"> click here. </a> </li> <li> Algebra 1 Honors is an honors level math class typically taken in 8th grade. I took it in 6th grade. I have taken the two tests that are required to get in, and while I don't know my exact score for the first one, it's safe to assume I got a good score. On the IAAT, I got the 99th percentile, a very high score. I was in A1H (Algebra 1 Honors), and it was nice to review what I already knew. One of the two tests is the IAAT or the Iowa Algebra Aptitude Test, which in order to take, you must pass the first test. To learn more about the IAAT's influence on the passing of Algebra 1 Honors, <a href="https://www.fcps.edu/node/41105"> click here. </a> </li> <li> I have finished the Honors Geometry course. We reviewed skills in Honors Algebra and learned about Angles/Distance, Triangle Congruence, Proofs, Vectors, Transformations, Quadrilaterals and other polygons, Triangle Centers, and Ratios/Proportions, and Right Triangle Trigonometry. I enjoyed the class very much, and finished with an A+.  </li> <li> Math Kangaroo is a math competition that takes place every year. It scores you depending on your score on the exam given every year. The exams are divided into grade levels, and the top twenty get the national level, while the top 5 or so get the state level. I have gotten the national level almost every time that I have taken the Math Kangaroo exam. To read more about the Math Kangaroo, <a href="https://www.mathkangaroo.org/"> click here. </a> </li> <li> I am also able to code, as you can see from this website. I started coding during the pandemic, when everyone was bored out of their minds, stuck at home with basically nothing to do. I found a new hobby/activity/skill to learn. I began to take classes with WhiteHatJr, now called Byju's Future School. They provide a program with 144+ classes that covers a whole ton of coding, starting from blockly coding, and moving up to HTML, CSS, and JS coding. I finished taking all 300 classes. This is the <a href="https://www.whitehatjr.com/"> WhiteHatJr website </a>, and this is the <a href="https://www.byjusfutureschool.com/"> Byju's Future School website. </a> I really recommend taking coding lessons, if you are interested, because the classes cover a lot of topics, from Sequences, Loops, and App Designing, to Neural Networks, Hash Codes, and Encryption/Decryption. All of the lessons are 1 to 1, which makes learning super fun! Now, I am learning C++ with a tutor, in order to participate in USACO (USA Coding Olympiad). I am also taking/taken courses from Google and Princeton University (through Coursera). If you wish to visit USACO's website, <a href="http://usaco.org">click here. </a> The link to Google's free crash course on machine learning that I completed is <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course">here.</a> If you are interested in Coursera, <a href="https://www.coursera.org">here</a> is the link to their website. </li> <li> I also made a journal during the pandemic! It includes a lot of topics, including my daily routine, my vacations, my hobbies, and so much more! I even included my opinions on some of the more interesting articles in the Time magazine. Most of the articles that I wrote about are about global warming, as that is a topic that I am quite passionate about. I want to help stop global warming and its effects on our planet, and the first step in doing that is to let the people know more about what's going on around the world. If you <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BCGRnnwnxFxthxPA1jTFFMhPsTTGB9KHgmkYJoZF2zM/edit?usp=sharing"> click here, </a> you will be able to learn more about me during the pandemic. I have written as in a viewer perspective and made it quite thrilling to read. (Don't worry, you are authorized to read it. (You'll see what I mean once you open the slides...)) Anyways, I hope you enjoy scrolling through all 50 slides. I recommend viewing it in present mode in order to get the full experience. </li> <li> I got a score of 1510 on the SAT, which I used to participate in both sessions of John Hopkins University CTY for my 7th grade summer and get a Grand Honors title in the CTY Talent Search. I had so much fun, and made so many new friends that I still keep in touch with, albeit occasionally. I also learned a lot during my time there. I took two computer science classes, Fundamentals of Computer Science and Data and Algorithms. The first class was mostly review, while in the second class, I learned more than I thought was possible in a period of just 3 weeks. All in all, CTY was truly one of the best times I ever had, even though it was my first time spending 6 weeks without my parents/family. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vSOxDLJumQSKPrvP3e6MHHCzNjwSku4tvEFe-nyZ5Ho/edit?usp=sharing"> Here </a> is my journal that I wrote during my 6 weeks away at CTY! </li> <li> I won my school spelling bee in 6th grade, and got up to the top 5 in my county. It took a lot of hard work and effort, and even though I didn't win the county spelling bee, I still learned a lot of unique words, such as omnilegent, that I will be sure to encounter throughout the rest of my life. While studying for the spelling bee, I was also preparing for the MathCounts chapter competition, which I got 4th in. This allowed me to move on to the states level, though I wasn't able to advance further from that stage. It was a huge learning experience for me, and I will hold on to that for years to come. Thanks for reading this far, you're almost to the end! </li> </ol> <h3> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b7hNiPVUrOkmU3HVTpL3cxCaIcFBp5Oc?usp=sharing"> Click here</a> if you want to see the awards/certificates mentioned above! </h3> <br> <h2 id="conclusion"> I hope that you are as proud of your achievements as I am! </h2> </p>

            <h2> Favorite Subject </h2>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p> My favorite subject is math, because I find it quite enjoyable whenever I discover/learn a new property/theorem that I never knew existed. I love to think through problems slowly and carefully. Math helps me concentrate and unlike some of my classmates, it's one of my favorite subjects. I also really love science and english. Science helps me learn more about my surroundings and the world. It has, and will continue to save lives and help people live better lives. For example, without science, COVID-19 would have been much worse, and could have wiped out the entire population. At least the vaccines slowed down deaths enough to save millions of lives. Even though not all discoveries are reliable, a hypothesis with solid evidence and proof behind it is definitely worth checking out. My dream job is becoming a doctor, and science is a major part of getting a doctor's degree. English allows me to learn how to find hidden meanings within passages by analyzing them, while also getting to read interesting/fun books in class. Some of my favorites include Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Heroes of Olympus, Kane Chronicles, Magnus Chase, Wings of Fire, Restart, Arc of a Scythe, Refugee, Warriors, and so many more! I have read so many books in my lifetime, I even have a mini library inside of my room. Check out this great math website, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"> Khan Academy. </a> It has courses for all grades, and all you need to do to access all of that great content is to make a free account. That's it! There's even coding lessons and science courses for upper grades. Speaking of science, you've probably heard of Nat Geo, right? Their website is packed full of sciency information that it will blow your mind! The <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/"> Nat Geo website </a> is definitely worth checking out. What's more, there's a <a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/"> Nat Geo Kids website </a> for the little kids that love cute animals! They have plenty of short videos for bite-sized info bits and personality quizzes to discover more about yourself. Last but not least, check out <a href="https://www.myon.com/index.html"> Myon, </a> a great resource for online books. With hundreds, or possibly more, book choices, Myon is the ultimate bookworm haven. You will most likely need a school account to log in, though. I would also recommend (if it's within your budget) to get a Kindle. It has changed my experience while reading books. I can switch from one book to another instantly, and I don't have to worry about losing my page.  I hope you found these resources interesting, and thank you for reading! Goodbye for now! </p>

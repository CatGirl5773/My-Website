        </div>
        <p> Hi! I am Esther J. Choi, a 6th grader that is 12 years old. I made this website to share who I am, what I like, and what I do to others. I hope you enjoy learning more about me, and perhaps in relating to me in similar ways. You can always refer to the navigation bar on top of the page if you want to skip a section. Now, enjoy reading about me! (P.S. I encourage you to try making a website on your own, on any topic you want! The coding languages that I used were HTML and CSS, and the platform that I used was Visual Studio Code.) </p>
        </section>
        <section id="my_family">
        <h2> My Family </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <div>
        <p> My family isn't that large, since I am an only child, and therefore don't have any siblings. My father is a buisness man who works every weekday to help elderly people enjoy their day at his facility, called Agape. My mother is a pharmacist who works in the same building that my father owns. She provides the medication that the elders need for their wellbeing. I am also the owner of 2 cats, with the names of Atom and Crystal. They are both black and white, two littermates amongst a litter of 4 kittens. My parents have provided me the tools to success, and I can't thank them enough for it. They put me on the road to become better every day, and they have helped me more times than I can count. They have taught me many necessary attributes in life, which will help me throughout my years. That is why my family is so important to me. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="hobbies">
        <h2> Hobbies </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I have mutiple hobbies, including reading and playing with my cats. I love to read, mostly fiction and fantasy, though sometimes I will pick up a nonfiction book. Some of my favorite series include Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Heroes of Olympus, Wings of Fire, Warriors, the Seven Realms, and the Kingdom Keepers. I could read all day if I wanted to. I usually read with my kindle, since it damages my eyes less, but I also read using a real book as well. Reading helps me to learn new words in a fun way, and imagine stories of my own. I believe that reading is essential in becoming a better writer and reader, which is why I think that reading is a great hobby to have! I hope that you love to read books as well. I encourage all of the people out there to read at home, especially during the pandemic, when people are suffering from depression. Reading will fill the gap of talking to friends in person. Also, playing with my cats helps me to relax and enjoy the day. My cats are like a stress reliever, and whenever I feel bad, my cats always help me feel better. It helps both them and myself to have some fun during the day. I also got a puppy recently, and she is the sweetest thing! I love her so much, which helps to stay calm and focused. Those are the reasons why I love having these hobbies! </p>

        <section id="activities">
        <h2> Activities </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I do a lot of things during the week. These include violin lessons, coding classes, piano lessons, and Spanish lessons. I do violin and piano lessons on Thursdays, coding classes on Saturdays and Sundays, and Spanish lessons twice a week whenever I have time, usually Wednesday and Friday. I have private teachers for violin and piano lessons, I use Byju's Future School for coding classes, and I use LanguageConvo for my Spanish Lessons. I also do my own activities, including my math textbook and practicing my instruments. I am doing the AoPS Introduction to Algebra textbook by Richard Rusczyk, in order to solidify my understanding of the subject. I have done more than halfway through the book. This textbook includes problems from math competitions, such as MathCounts, AMC 8/10/12, the Mandelbrot Competition, the Harvard/MIT Mathmetics Tournament, UNCC, and ARML. To visit the AoPS website, click on <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/"> this link. </a> I practice (or try to) 1 hour every day for each of my instruments. I usually enjoy practicing once I start, which is why and how I have come this far. I have to thank all of the people who have helped me, my teachers, my parents, and my friends, for encouraging me to persevere and continue through my hardships. They are the reason I am writing this. </p>

        <h2> Achievements </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> My achievements include playing two instruments, speaking 4 languages, qualifying for Algebra 1 Honors, placing in the Nationals level for Math Kangaroo, and so much more! <ol> <li> The two instruments that I play are the violin and piano. I am pretty advanced at them, and passed the audition for AYDO Second and First Violin. AYDO (American Youth Debut Orchestra) is an orchestra that is part of the AYPO program. AYDO is the lowest level, while AYP is the highest. I have auditioned for AYSE, the next level of orchestras, but failed. To read more about the AYDO orchestra, <a href="https://www.aypo.org/aydo"> click here. </a> I am currently playing Mozart Violin Concerto No. 5 Mvmt. 1, the last of his violin concertos. To listen to the music, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD3RpN-jmGY"> click here. </a> I also play Wienawski Etude-Caprice No. 4, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHvWMoRbbww"> right here. </a> For piano, I haven't really done any competitions, but I am playing Mozart Piano Sonata No. 11 and Chopin Waltz Posthumous No. 14 in E minor. To listen to the former, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ1mj9IaczQ"> click here. </a> 
        To listen to the latter, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YNOfilFSog"> click here. </a> </li> <li> The four languages that I can speak are English, Korean, Spanish, and Chinese. I am not fluent in Chinese, but I can speak a few words and read passages. I am currently learning Chinese and Spanish. English is my main language, while Korean is my second language from my parents. I go to Chinese School every day at Hope Chinese School. I am currently learning 6th grade Chinese. To go to their website, <a href="https://www.hopechineseschool.org/campus/8/"> click here. </a> I am learning Spanish using Duolingo and LanguageConvo, a program that lets you schedule classes with a native teacher in whatever language you want to learn. Duolingo is an app that teaches you a new language through a course of lessons and different topics. To go to the Duolingo website, <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/"> click on this link. </a> To get to the LanguageConvo website, <a href="https://www.languageconvo.com/"> click here. </a> </li> <li> Algebra 1 Honors lets you take Algebra 1 classes in 6th grade. I have taken the tests, and while I don't know my score for the first one, it's safe to assume I got a good score. On the IAAT, I got 99th percentile, a very high score. I am now in A1H (Algebra 1 Honors), and it's enjoying to review what I already know. One of the two tests is the IAAT or the Iowa Algebra Aptitude Test, which in order to take, you must pass the first test. To learn more about the IAAT's influence on the passing of Algebra 1 Honors, <a href="https://www.fcps.edu/node/41105"> click here. </a> </li> <li> Math Kangaroo is a math competition that takes place every year. It scores you depending on your score on the exam given every year. The exams are divided into grade levels, and the top twenty get the national level, while the top 5 or so get the state level. I have gotten the national level almost every time that I have taken the Math Kangaroo exam. To read more about the Math Kangaroo, <a href="https://www.mathkangaroo.org/"> click here. </a> </li> <li> I am also pretty good at coding, as you can see from this website. I have been taking classes with WhiteHatJr, now called Byju's Future School. They provide a program with 144+ classes that covers a whole ton of coding, starting from blockly coding, and moving up to HTML, CSS, and JS coding. I am at around class 190 right now, and I am loving the system. This is the <a href="https://www.whitehatjr.com/"> WhiteHatJr website </a>, and this is the <a href="https://www.byjusfutureschool.com/"> Byju's Future School website. </a> I really recommend taking coding lessons, if you are interested, because the classes cover a lot of topics, from Sequences, Loops, and App Designing, to Neural Networks, Hash Codes, and Encryption/Decryption. All of the lessons are 1 to 1, which makes learning super fun! </li> <li> I also made a journal during the pandemic! It includes a lot of topics, including my daily routine, my vacations, my hobbies, and so much more! I even included my opinions on some of the more interesting articles in the Time magazine. If you <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BCGRnnwnxFxthxPA1jTFFMhPsTTGB9KHgmkYJoZF2zM/edit?usp=sharing"> click here, </a> you will be able to learn more about me. I have written as in a viewer perspective and made it quite thrilling to read. (Don't worry, you are authorized to read it. (You'll see what I mean once you open the slides...)) Anyways, I hope you enjoy scrolling through all 50 slides. I recommend viewing it in present mode in order to get the full experience. Peace out, and goodbye! (Until next time...) </li> </ol> <h3 id="conclusion"> I hope that you are as proud of your achievements as I am! </h3> </p>

            <h2> Favorite Subject </h2>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p> My favorite subject is math, because I am so good at it compared to everyone else. I also really love science and reading, because I love learning about nature and reading books. Some of my favorites include Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Heroes of Olympus, Kane Chronicles, Magnus Chase, Wings of Fire, Restart, Arc of a Scythe, Refugee, Warriors, and so many more! I have read so many books in my lifetime, I even have a mini library inside of my room. I also really like math, because I love to think through problems slowly and carefully, making sure not to make even one mistake. I also like to check back my work, just to make sure I got everything right. Math helps me concentrate and unlike most of my classmates, it's one of my favorite subjects. Science helps me learn more about my surroundings and the world. It has, and will continue to save lives and help people live better lives. For example, without science, COVID-19 would have been much worse, and could have wiped out the entire population. At least the vaccines slowed down deaths enough to save millions of lives. Even though not all discoveries are reliable, a hypothesis with solid evidence and proof behind it is definitely worth checking out. My dream job is becoming a doctor, and science is a major part of getting a doctor's degree. Check out this great math website, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"> Khan Academy. </a> It has courses for all grades, and all you need to do to access all of that great content is to make a free account. That's it! There's even coding lessons and science courses for upper grades. Speaking of science, you've probably heard of Nat Geo, right? Their website is packed full of sciency information that it will blow your mind! The <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/"> Nat Geo website </a> is definitely worth checking out. What's more, there's a <a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/"> Nat Geo Kids website </a> for the little kids that love cute animals! They have plenty of short videos for bite-sized info bits and personality quizzes to discover more about yourself. Last but not least, check out <a href="https://www.myon.com/index.html"> Myon, </a> a great resource for online books. With hundreds, or possibly more, book choices, Myon is the ultimate bookworm haven. You will most likely need a school account to log in, though. I hope you found these resources interesting, and thank you for reading! Goodbye for now! </p>
